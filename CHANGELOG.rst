1.2.1 (2021-09-20)
==================

Open Notificaties 1.2.1 fixes a resource leak. See the below info box for more details.

.. note::

  Notifications are delivered to subscriptions via asynchronous background workers.
  These background tasks were incorrectly storing the execution metadata and result in
  the backend without consuming/ pruning them from  the result store. The symptoms
  should have been fixed with the 1.2.0 release where the default backend is switched
  to Redis instead of RabbitMQ (which normally does evict keys after a certain timeout)
  - but this release fixes the root cause. Result and metadata are now no longer stored.

1.2.0 (2021-09-15)
==================

**Fixes**

* Fixed the webserver and background worker processes not having PID 1
* Containers now run as un-privileged user rather than the root user (open-zaak/open-zaak#869)
* Added Celery Flower to the container images for background worker task monitoring

**New features**

* Added support for generic OpenID Connect admin authentication (open-zaak/open-zaak#1034)

1.1.5 (2021-04-15)
==================

Bugfix release

* Bumped ADFS libraries to support current state of Azure AD
* Fixed issue with self-signed certificates loading

1.1.4 (2021-03-25)
==================

Quality of life release

* Updated to pip-tools 6 internally for dependency management
* Bumped Django and Jinja2 dependencies to get their respective bug- and security fixes
* Added support for self-signed (root) certificates, see the documentation on readthedocs
  for more information.
* Clarified version numbers display in footer

1.1.3 (2021-03-17)
==================

Bugfix release fixing some deployment issues

* Fixed broken ``STATIC_URL`` and ``MEDIA_URL`` settings derived from ``SUBPATH``. This
  should fix CSS/Javascript assets not loading in
* Removed single-server documentation duplication (which was outdated too)
* Removed ``raven test`` command from documentation, it was removed.
* Made CORS set-up opt-in

1.1.2 (2020-12-17)

1.1.1 (2020-11-09)
==================

Small quality of life release.

* Fixed broken links in docs
* Bumped dev-tools isort, black and pip-tools to latest versions
* Fixed tests by mocking HTTP calls that weren't mocked yet

==================

Feature and small improvements release.

.. note:: The API remains unchanged.
